These are the 4 examples that appeared in the FTP article in the
second edition of The Perl Journal

download    Example of downloading files from a FTP server, 1 by 1
downmulti   Example of downloading multiple files at once
fdcopy	    Example of copying files between two servers
pasvcopy    Example of using PASV mode

These example should work OK with a few minor tweaks. You will need to
modify the FTP host name etc.
